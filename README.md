This repository is part of a [series of Java tutorials for a Rational class](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/tutorials/rational/) written by [Phill Conrad](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad) for [CMPSC 56](ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io), a Java course taught in the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu) at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu).

# Quick start

Once you clone this repo, these commands show how to compile and run the code inside.

In the previous lessson, [ex01](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/tutorials/rational_ex01/), we used simple Java `javac` and `java` commands to compile and run.   In this lesson, we use a tool called [`ant`](http://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/ant/).    

* If you are using [CSIL](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/csil/), then `ant` should already be installed.
* If you are using your own computer system, you may need to install `ant`.  Refer to the article on [`ant`](http://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/ant/) for more information.

Here are example commands to compile and run the code in this repo:
